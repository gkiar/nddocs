When running the neurodata analytics software stack, one can take advantage of single workstation Amazon AWS instances, or (if a close collaborator) make use of our captive cluster environment.

AMI
---

On the Amazon Community Marketplace, we have released an AMI which can be found by searching for the string 'neurodata'. The AMI is still in alpha stages, so if you notice issues please report them using our `support forum`_ in order to see them addressed.

If you wish to standup our software stack on your own, or are wondering how the AMI was made, you can checkout our `AMI build guide`_.

Captive Cluster
---------------

For those of you who work closely with us at JHU, we have a cluster named Braincloud which you can make use of to process your data. Please contact a member of the team for more details.
